# 简介

> 开发商：Han-Squirrel Studio, XD

Into the Desert…
This is a fantastical tale of an exotic land. The Old Empire has fallen, leaving rival tribes to fight for control of the great desert. Little do they know of the seeds of darkness which grow in the shadows with each passing day…
Sands of Salzaar is an open-world strategy-action RPG set across a sprawling desert. Build up and manage your forces from a single unit to a mighty army, then lead them into massive battles against your foes. How you progress is up to you: customize your hero with a wide variety of skills and talents, choose which factions to side with, and plan your strategies carefully to establish yourself as whoever you aspire to be – a lone wolf, a wealthy trader, a city lord, or a war schemer.
Game Features

Epic War & Strategy – Customize your abilities to become a martial arts master, powerful archmage, and more. Recruit and train your force with new features like command skills and a fresh system to upgrade units. Lead them into waves of real-time sieges and skirmishes to win.
Explore a Dynamic Open World – Roam across a giant map to encounter various characters, take on quests, enter deadly dungeons for boss fights and loot, amass gold from trading and build up your own cities…Every playthrough makes you stronger and offers new adventures that reflect the decisions you make.
Alliance or Hostility? – Declare war, or make peace and team up with rival factions utilizing diplomacy tactics. V1.0 introduces more diversity to social relationships and tribal affairs across the land, adding AI rebellions, tribal titles and a new Favor system between NPCs.
