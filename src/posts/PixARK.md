# 简介

> 开发商：Snail Games USA

Welcome to PixARK, a vast, wild world filled with vicious dinosaurs, magical creatures and endless adventure! To survive in this mysterious land, you must tame creatures both ferocious and cuddly, craft high tech and magical tools, and build your own base out of cubes.
With a robust character creator, an infinite number of voxel based maps and procedurally generated quests, your PixARK adventure will be completely unique. Team up with friends to form a tribe, or play on your own. Spend your time building a towering fortress or go on a quest in a sprawling cavern. Fly on the back of a dragon and smite your enemies with a magic wand, or ride a mighty T-Rex and blast your foes with a rocket launcher. In the world of PixARK, how you play is up to you – as long as you survive!
Skyward Expansion DLC new features:
A new enemy has appeared in the world of PixARK, looking to exhaust the plentiful supply minerals. To safeguard the World of PixARK and its vast mineral supply, Explorers will have to stand up against the invaders. Explorers have begun using the enemy’s own technology against them to upgrade their weapons and gear in an effort to fight fire with fire. The future of PixARK is now in the hands of you, the Explorers!
