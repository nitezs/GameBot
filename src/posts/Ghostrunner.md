# 简介

> 开发商：One More Level, All in! Games, 505 Games

Ghostrunner is a hardcore FPP slasher packed with lightning-fast action, set in a grim, cyberpunk megastructure. Climb Dharma Tower, humanity’s last shelter, after a world-ending cataclysm. Make your way up from the bottom to the top, confront the tyrannical Keymaster, and take your revenge.
Ghostrunner offers a unique single-player experience: fast-paced, violent combat, and an original setting that blends science fiction with post-apocalyptic themes. It tells the story of a world that has already ended and its inhabitants who fight to survive.
The streets of this tower city are full of violence. Mara the Keymaster rules with an iron fist and little regard for human life.
As resources diminish, the strong prey on the weak and chaos threatens to consume what little order remains. The decisive last stand is coming. A final attempt to set things right before mankind goes over the edge of extinction.
As the most advanced blade fighter ever created, you’re always outnumbered but never outclassed. Slice your enemies with a monomolecular katana, dodge bullets with your superhuman reflexes, and employ a variety of specialized techniques to prevail.
One-hit one-kill mechanics make combat fast and intense. Use your superior mobility (and frequent checkpoints!) to engage in a never-ending dance with death fearlessly.
Project_Hel DLC Expansion:
Just prior to the events of the original Ghostrunner storyline, a combat android known as Hel begins her own violent mission: quelling a rebellion at the base of the tower-city. Yet Hel’s true motivation takes root in hatred toward the creators keeping her chained between assignments. Internal programming keeps her from slaughtering them outright, so she begrudgingly follows orders while looking for loopholes to disrupt her creators’ grand plans.
Project_Hel DLC expansion features:

Unlike regular Ghostrunners, Hel contains no biological parts, instead driven by a cobbled-together AI rendering her unstable, impulsive, and angry. These traits manifest in Project_Hel’s new Rage bar. Fill it up by killing enemies to gain abilities injecting fresh blood into Ghostrunner’s one-hit-one-kill combat. Reject death with the attack-negating Shield, bypass enemy defenses with Unblockable strikes, and strike from afar with devastating energy Surges.
Instead of using a Gap Jammer grappling hook like original protagonist Jack, Hel’s powerful Super Jump provides aggressive movement capabilities both for traversal and combat. She can also air dash significantly further and use a Sensory Boost to quickly visualize their trajectory. These differences give Hel her own feel and style appealing to Ghostrunner veterans and newcomers alike. Upgrade her capabilities even further with a revamped progression system.
Face off against new challengers, including four enemy types and two bosses. Carve through the seven imaginative levels while mastering Hel’s intricacies and rebelling against her creators. Ascend the neon cityscapes to the tune of additional tracks from electronic artist Daniel Deluxe. Uncover more context in this action-packed prequel story by gathering hidden collectibles. Learn how Hel rises to become one of the toughest bosses in the original Ghostrunner plot.

Included DLCs:

Halloween Pack
Digital Artbook
Winter Pack
Metal OX Pack
Neon Pack
