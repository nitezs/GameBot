# 简介

> 开发商：Lighthouse Games Studio

Dodge and carve your way through swarms of terrifying sea creatures controlled by Death, a vicious giant mind-controlling Kraken that haunts your every move. Scavenge for hidden treasure to unlock weapons, and upgrades to help you in your fight for survival. Every dive reveals a new nightmare.
Gameplay:
Death in the Water 2 at its core is a wave-based shooter but combines elements of terrifying horror and tension with heart-pounding adrenalin-fueled action.
Each dive (wave) typically starts off with elements of exploration where the pace is a bit slower and gives you a chance to find treasure, and other collectibles as well as find your bearings. During this phase, the tension builds as you investigate ruins, wrecks, and reefs. Sharks and creatures are passive and may not always attack you unless provoked, much like the behavior of real sharks.
At any stage during the dive Death (the Kraken) will launch a mind-control attack on all creatures and a feeding frenzy will kick off with you being the primary target. You will need to survive and complete the dive objective before you move on to the next wave. As you progress to the next dive the difficulty ramps up and things get even more frantic. The combination of tension and action makes it incredibly addictive as you explore the open world map.
Will you escape the clutches of the Kraken, or will you join the endless ranks of the drowned?
This is a game about facing your fears head on and conquering the challenges that stand in your way. It’s about testing your limits and pushing yourself to the brink. It’s about survival, and emerging victorious against all odds.
So, strap on your diving gear and get ready for the ultimate underwater horror experience.
Death awaits you in the depths…
