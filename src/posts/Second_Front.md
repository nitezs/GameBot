Game Features

Second Front features 48 epic scenarios set in iconic locations of World War II, including the Stalingrad Factory District, Borisov, and Korostychiv.
Second Front includes an editor to not only create and share custom maps but also complete campaigns. Players can then share their creations with the steam community – making Second Front an infinite tactical sandbox experience.
Craft your own treacherous maps and scenarios in the integrated scenario and map editor. Then share with your allies on the steam community.
Command the battlefield with absolute precision and realism. Outmaneuver your opponent while compensating for realistic persistent loss, unit fatigue and other unforeseen battlefield considerations.
Choose to play as German, American or Russian forces, with unique leaders from each nation casting influence over the battlefield.
Over 40 infantry units to command, each with its own tactical function and strategic value.
Build a mechanized army from over 216 types of tanks, vehicles, ordnance and weaponry including MGs, Flamethrowers, Mortars, Panzerschrecks and Bazookas.
Competitive AI, built from emergent AI behaviour, provides a more challenging and adaptive opponent on the battlefield.
Easy-to-identify controls and mechanics make Second Front easy to play, while the in-depth strategic layers make it a challenge to master.
Play over a wide variety of terrain, with 30 terrain types, 148 types of destructible and flammable buildings, bridges and environment pieces.
