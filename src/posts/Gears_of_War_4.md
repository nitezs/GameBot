# 简介

> 开发商：The Coalition / Microsoft Studios

A new saga begins for one of the most acclaimed video game franchises in history. After narrowly escaping an attack on their village, JD Fenix and his friends, Kait and Del, must rescue the ones they love and discover the source of a monstrous new enemy. Never Fight Alone: Enjoy two-player co-op campaign with friends locally via split-screen or over Xbox Live. Player 2 can select either Kait or Del. Horde 3.0: Team up with four others and battle wave after wave of increasingly difficult enemies by choosing your combat class, leveling up your skills and deploying fortifications anywhere on the map. Explosive Versus Multiplayer: Compete online in new and favorite game types, all at 60fps on dedicated servers. A new visible ranking system means fairer matchmaking for social, competitive and professional players alike.


Make sure you have Windows 10 x64, build 1607 or later. Windows Store, Xbox and Xbox Identity applications must be installed for crack to work
Windows virtualization (Hyper-V Support) must be set off either in OS settings and/or in BIOS
Developer Mode must be turned on your OS. My installer tries to turn it on automatically, but if fails, make sure to turn it on manually
If you don’t uncheck the option in the installer, the crack will automatically apply after final files verification
If you unckecked the option, you must run the crack manually from the desktop icon
After the crack applied, GoW4 will appear on your Start Menu – you can drag the game to desktop and make a shortcut icon
If the crack still doesn’t work – something is off with reqirements listed above: Windows version, dev.mode, etc.
Upon the first launch the game will ask you for folder to keep saves in. You either create a new subfolder, like “GOW4” or use any existing folder
You MUST block game .EXE (GearGame\Binaries\UWP64\GearGame.exe) from the Internet. Otherwise it will crash right after you try to start a new campaign
Both inbound and outbound connections must be blocked. For default Windows Firewall check this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9qms8gQ-SI
If you can’t block the game, simply turn off your Internet cable to play
To play in Versus mode with bots, create a LAN party and turn “Fill Empty Slots with Bots” in game settings


You can skip downloading of selective and optional files you don’t need. Here is the list of such files:

fg-selective-english.bin (a MUST for all languages w/o their own voiceovers)
fg-selective-brazilian.bin
fg-selective-chinese.bin
fg-selective-french.bin
fg-selective-german.bin
fg-selective-italian.bin
fg-selective-spanish.bin
fg-selective-spanish-latam.bin
fg-optional-multiplayer.bin (should be installed if you want to play Versus MP mode)

In example, if you want to launch the game without MP support, but with German UI/Subtitles/Voiceovers – skip all “selective/optional” files, but download fg-selective-german.bin & all main files (01-11).
Remember, that at least one speech pack must be downloaded and installed.
