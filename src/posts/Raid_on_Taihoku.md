On May, 31th, 1945, hundreds of American B-24 Liberators raided the capital of this island, Taipei. Many of the residents died in the raid, while more of them survived, facing the broken hometown.
The leading character, Sayako, got amnesia due to the raid. In addition to surviving in the city ruined by the fire, she also has to step on the journey of finding her memories back. The Taiwanese dog, blacky, is her most reliable partner. In the raided Taipei, the girl and the dog set on their adventure together.
