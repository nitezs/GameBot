# 简介

> 开发商：MGP Studios, Solid9 Studio

An overdose of reality can have dire consequences…
Project Downfall (PDF for short) is a pill poppin’ first person adventure with semi-tactical in your face combat and unique perks and quirks. The game is an overall mashup of the the movie „Falling Down” with M.Douglas and the style of „Hardcore Henry” and „John Wick” in arcade retro stylised visuals with modern post effects and Dynamic Original SoundTrack.
You start in your apartment getting ready for another routine day at the office and your adventure starts from there. The storyline will progress with completion of main missions and branch out depending on various factors (chosen path, mental state, specific choice/interaction/pickup/etc).
You are a regular, middle class citizen. By day, leading your ordinary, rinse-repeat corpo-routine life, with your lovely girlfriend Olga by your side, a well paid job and crib with an amazing view. What more could a guy want?
Yet you feel privileged and as a true socialist you feel you need to give something back…
…By night, you give your contribution to society as a self-proclaimed dealer of justice, dispatching all sorts of scum with extreme prejudice… Or, at least that is what you think…
