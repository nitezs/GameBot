# 简介

> 开发商：Gaming Minds Studios, Kalypso Media

Ahoy, Me Hearties!
I bet y’all are curious as to why I summoned you on deck for a wee gathering and mingling. Well, it has come to me attention ye carousers are… how shall I put it… not amused with our most recent exploits. I smell the reek of mutiny infesting the lower decks…
So here I am, your very own, humble Captain:
Are you not entertained?
Didn’t I treat you well?
Was it the abundancy of grog?
The brimful barrels filled with tobacco?
The caring warmth of a bewitched siren while on shore leave?
Or my generosity of splitting the booty fair and square?
Enlighten me senses:
Is this all you signed up for? Is this the pirate life as you imagined it would be?
I challenge y’all: which of you landlubbers dares to speak of mutiny and spill your own captain’s blood to seize control over this ship?
Draw your cutlass right now or walk the plank and rest your pitiful existence in silence at the bottom of the seas…
Let me repeat my vows to this crew and this ship. I promised you an adventure and a life of great risk in return for spoils, riches and eternal fame.
We are the scourge of the Caribbean seas and we all know that dead men tell no tales – but it’s the crawling fear of our next victim that will spread the Pirate’s Tale…
Weigh anchor and hoist the mizzen, prepare the cannons and let’s chase that Spanish Treasure fleet before we set course back to Tortuga.
Game Features

BECOME THE PIRATE OF ALL PIRATES: You are not born a great pirate, but we give you the tools to make you THE great pirate. Customize your own Flag under which your fleet will sail. As you gain experience, your notoriety and skills will improve. Roleplay with more than 35 distinct pirate’s skills on your way to claim your pirate throne.
RAID AND VOYAGE THE CARIBBEAN SEA: The Caribbean of the 17th century is dominated by the four colonial powers of the Old World. Being a pirate is not your fault, but it is your responsibility! Take action to relieve the Spanish, Dutch, French and English colonies from their burden of drowning in riches. But be wary! Unless you are sure you are the biggest fish in the sea, don’t venture out too early or too far from your trusted hometown port.
ENGAGE IN TACTICAL NAVAL BATTLES: A ship is safe in a harbor, but that’s not what ships are made for. Fight in tactical turn-based naval battles on a hexagonal grid of epic proportions. Use your wits when raiding a convoy or a settlement. Victory is determined by a clever combination of your ship’s distinct armament with the varying and rough conditions of the sea.
UPGRADE YOUR FLEET: It is your job to maintain and upkeep a formidable fleet before facing the cannon hail of those mighty warships lurking in the seas. Combining distinct upgrades of your ship’s basic gear, such as weaponry, hull, mast, or figurehead allows for more than 360 unique loadouts.
MEET YOUR CREW’S NEEDS: As an elected captain of the ship, it is your responsibility to split the spoils and riches with your crew. Agreeing on so-called ‘articles of capture’ clearly define the objectives you embark on before leaving port. Remember the whispers of mutiny below the decks can lead to nasty outcome. After all, you are an elected captain and not placed by the grace of the Lord.
PARLEY WITH INFAMOUS PIRATE LEGENDS: On your journey to become the most fearsome, most glorious pirate captain, you will have the opportunity to get to know several historic pirates. Choose your foes and companions wisely…
COMMAND HISTORICAL SHIPS: Featuring 18 unique types of ships such as Ship of the Line, Frigate, War Galleon and many more.
DROWN IN QUESTS: Sink more than 25 hours into stories set in the Golden Age of Piracy. The world is your oyster after all. Governors and fellow pirate companion provide you with valuable questlines where a few doubloons can be made. Also don’t forget to seek out the local tavern and eavesdrop on the latest rumors. A bottle of rum loosens the tongue, showing the way to treasures otherwise hidden…
