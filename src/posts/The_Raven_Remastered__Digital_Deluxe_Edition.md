# 简介

> 开发商：KING Art / Nordic Games

The Raven Remastered is a full graphical remaster of the classic whodunit adventure that lets you explore a thrilling crime story through the eyes of multiple characters.
London, 1964. An ancient ruby is stolen from the British Museum. At the crime scene: a raven feather. Is somebody trying to follow in the footsteps of The Raven, the legendary master thief who disappeared years before?
Constable Anton Jakob Zellner finds himself in the middle of the kind of murder mystery he so far only knew from reading his favourite crime novels. Nothing is what it seems. Everyone has something to hide. And the Raven is always one step ahead…
The Digital Deluxe Edition includes:

Soundtrack (in .mp3 format)
Story book with detailed background info about the characters of the game
“Making of” booklet of the original game
Papercraft mask of The Raven (printable)
Four digital posters (printable)
