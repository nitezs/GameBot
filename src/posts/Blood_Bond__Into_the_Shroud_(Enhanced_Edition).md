# 简介

> 开发商：W.R.K.S Games

Blood Bond: Into the Shroud Enhanced Edition brings back the nostalgia of old-school RPGs with new graphics and story. With no hand-holding and few strict paths to follow, you will be rewarded for your exploration across Jordenheim and the discoveries you make. Blood Bond: Into the Shroud Enhanced Edition is heavily inspired by Norse myths and legends. Blood Bond: Into the Shroud Enhanced Edition brings more weapons, skills, crafting, quests, and combat encounters. Adding three different levels of difficulty, you have more control over your gameplay.
Play the role of Astrid, a young Viking witch, and daughter of two heroes of yore. Once praised by the village, Astrid’s family now lives as outcasts for reasons unknown and father absent. Astrid embarks on her journey after finding her mother missing. She will need to discover the truth behind her past and discover the Viking power within.
Game Features

Exploration & Discovery: Dive directly into exploring your environment. You’ll gain XP for everything you do from picking plants for medicine or discovering a mysterious setting.
Talents: Pray to the Gods to receive their blessing. What is bestowed upon you is completely up to them. Gain talents in a variety of ways from quests, boons from the gods, or discovering them through exploration.
Combat: Choose your battles wisely or use stealth to find another way. Be cautious with your ax, bow, and spells for there is no auto-targeting or easy mode combat.
Status Effects: Create buffs, debuffs, or states to aid in your journey. Don’t discredit a status effect as it may be beneficial in one situation and detrimental in another.
Crafting: Gather and craft clever items to ensure you succeed in your journey. Crafting is an essential part of your journey as you may not be able to obtain all talents, traits, and abilities on your journey.
Welcome to the world of Jordenheim and the saga of Astrid of Guilon.
