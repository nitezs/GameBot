The above mentioned new content is unlocked by progressing through the game.


You can skip downloading of bonus content and voicepacks you don’t need. Here is the list of selective/optional files:

fg-optional-bonus-content.bin (ArtBook + Wallpapers)
fg-selective-brazilian.bin
fg-selective-english.bin
fg-selective-french.bin
fg-selective-german.bin
fg-selective-greek.bin
fg-selective-italian.bin
fg-selective-japanese.bin
fg-selective-mexican.bin
fg-selective-polish.bin
fg-selective-portuguese.bin
fg-selective-russian.bin
fg-selective-spanish.bin

In example, if you want to launch the game with German UI/Subtitles/Voiceovers – skip all “selective/optional” files, but download fg-selective-german.bin & all main files (01-05).

Backwards Compatibility
This repack IS slightly backwards compatible with my previous DS repack. You can rehash fg-optional-bonus-content.bin to save 399 MB of traffic.
