# 简介

> 开发商：Digitality Studios, META Publishing

HordeCore is a kick-ass action side-scroller set in a post-apocalyptic world. Become the leader of an ever-expanding group of survivors. Manage supplies, upgrade your team, and craft deadly contraptions to defend yourself! Remember, exploration is vital in this harsh new world. Prepare to forge bizarre alliances and, together, face the many dangers of the wastelands. Take survival gameplay, combine it with base management, add RPG elements, and spice it up with a fully-fledged collectible card game – and you get HordeCore!
Besides all the zombie-killing and loot-grabbing you can handle, HordeCore also includes a complete, fully-featured Collectible Card Game!
Horde Tactics is a deck building card game, featuring 60+ cards that you’ll gather and unlock during your time in the Wasteland. Each card represents an item, character or a Hordeling that you encounter in the game—that way, your collection grows alongside your progress in HordeCore!
