# 简介

> 开发商：DOOMISH

Emanate is a ‘to the top’ style of platformer, meaning it’s a single-level, vertical world. If you fall, you’ll have to retrace your steps to get back to where you were and continue making progress! The game starts slow and steady, then builds up to a fiercely challenging platformer towards the end, with a multitude of mechanics to memorize and adapt to. These mechanics appear in front of you as you move, keeping you on your toes as you climb to the top.
The most common mechanics you’ll encounter are the orange/red bounce pads, purple wall-jump pads, and the fading platforms, that vanish from under your feet after a very short amount of time. Combining these simple mechanics urges you to keep moving forward, making for some incredibly challenging and intense platforming gameplay.
Game Features

Moody, atmospheric environments: Starting from the bedrock of oblivion, up through deep ethereal forests and vast looming clouds, to huge other-worldly cathedrals.
Fast, exciting soundtrack: An ambient, break-techno tracklist that increases in speed and intensity as you progress through the game.
Emanation orbs: In normal mode, you have three chances per checkpoint to learn the patterns ahead of you. If you fall, expend an orb and you’ll recall back to the last checkpoint you activated. Any misstep after your orbs are gone and you’ll find yourself falling back down below. Or, for the braver souls, hard mode strips you of this ability, leaving you to face the consequences of your missteps and blunders each and every time.
