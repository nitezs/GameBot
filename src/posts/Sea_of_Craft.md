# 简介

> 开发商：Wizard Games

Welcome aboard, Captain, to planet Beella! “Sea of Craft” is a sandbox ocean-building game with realistic physics simulation. You can build your exclusive ship with hundreds of materials, explore intriguing stages and claim champion, challenge your opponents, pirates and monsters. Sail through the Uncharted Lands on planet Beella!
Build with realistic physics simulation and create things beyond imagination
Based on the realistic physics simulation and highly customizable designs, Captains can assemble their exclusive vehicles with hundreds of components and materials such as decks, drivers, weapons and spray in three building scenarios of desert oasis, realistic archipelago and infinite ocean. From ocean to lands, and the air, you can leverage your imagination as much as you can. An age of creation is arriving!
Clear intriguing stages. Who shall claim the domination of the Uncharted Lands?
Ocean cruise? Dribbling with hooks? Homeless baby crocodiles are waiting for you to rescue! Captains can learn building and sailing techniques at theme stages, using their wisdom and skill to solve the intriguing quiz. There isn’t only one way to clear the stage. Only those who explore ingeniously can be ranked on the rankings and claim the title of champion. Captains can also conquer pirates and mysterious monsters on the unregulated high seas to collect treasures for ship modification; or join the multiplayer free-for-all, hunting and chasing to go after the title of “Ace of the Sea”!
Share blueprints with real-time workshop interactions
Talented shipbuilders gathering at Marine Association are willing to share knowledge and good at expressing compliments. Captains can upload their blueprints in Workshop, and download works from other Captains, with ships, vehicles and aircraft included. Add works to Favorite to gain Favor, and don’t miss the Exotic Touring Exhibition of grandmasters!
Sailing on realistic waters with immersive experience
With realistic ocean simulations and lovely scenic sound effects, you can create an ultra-immersive sea space for a wonderfully immersive experience. From the vast ocean to countless archipelagos, as well as the remnants of lost civilizations on planet Beella, the peace of the “Medieval Age” will be shattered by the industrial machinery of the “Steam Age”, overturning Captain’s imagination of the sea!
